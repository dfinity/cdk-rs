/// callback which is triggered after the future made progress. The waker would
/// then. The waker would then poll the future one last time to advance it to
/// the final state. For that, we pass the future pointer to the waker, so that
/// it can be restored into a box from a raw pointer and then dropped if not
/// needed anymore.
///
/// Technically, we store 2 pointers on the heap: the pointer to the future
/// itself, and a pointer to that pointer. The reason for this is that the waker
/// API requires us to pass one thin pointer, while a a pointer to a `dyn Trait`
/// can only be fat. So we create one additional thin pointer, pointing to the
/// fat pointer and pass it instead.
