## [unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-16

- `ic-cdk-timers` no longer has a dependency on `ic-cdk` and no longer needs to be upgraded when `ic-cdk` is upgraded.
- Breaking: Timer bodies have been changed from `FnOnce`/`FnMut` to `Future`/`AsyncFnMut`, so `spawn` is no longer required to enter an async context from a timer. For `set_timer`, `|| {}` should be changed to `async {}`, and for `set_timer_interval`, `|| {}` should be changed to `async || {}`.
  - If you have any immediate `spawn` calls, you can remove them and run the async code directly. (You do not have to.)
