:cdk: Rust Canister Development Kit (CDK)

Rust is a powerful and type sound modern programming language with an active developer community.
Because Rust compiles to WebAssembly, it offers a rich development environment for writing applications to run on the {IC}.
To help pave the way for writing applications in Rust that can be deployed on the {IC}, {company-id} provides some tools to simplify the process.

Collectively, these tools are referred to as the {cdk-long-name} and consist of the following main libraries:

|Package |Description

|`+ic_types+` |The `+ic_types+` crate defines the types used to communicate with the {IC} replica, and when building applications to be deployed as canisters on the {IC}.

|`+ic_agent+` |The `+ic-agent+` library enables direct communication with the {IC} replica.

|`+ic_utils+` |The `+ic_utils+` library provides utilities for managing calls and applications deployed as canisters.


|`+ic_cdk+` |The `+ic_cdk+` provides the core methods that enable Rust programs to interact with the {IC} mainysstem API. This library serves as the runtime core of the Rust CDK.

|`+ic_cdk_macros+` |The `+ic_cdk_macros+` library defines the procedural macros that facilitate building operation endpoints and API. This library includes key macros for `+update+`, `+query+`, `+import+` and other important operations.

|`+ic_cdk_optimizer+` |The `+ic_cdk_optimizer+` is a helper liberary used to reduce the size of WebAssembly modules.

The following diagram provides a simplified view of the {cdk} building blocks from the lowest to highest level of abstraction.
