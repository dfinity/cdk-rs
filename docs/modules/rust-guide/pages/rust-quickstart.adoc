[[quick-start-intro]]
The {cdk-long-name} provides tools, sample code, and documentation to help you create programs to run on the {IC} network.
This _Hello, World! Rust CDK Quick Start_ assumes that you are installing the {cdk-short-name} for the first time. 

To help you get started, this tutorial illustrates how to modify the traditional "Hello World" first program to use the {cdk-short-name}. 
This simple program has just one function that prints text to a terminal, but it provides a good model for understanding the workflow when writing programs in Rust that you want to deploy on the {IC}.

[[before-you-begin]]
== Before you begin

Before you download and install the {cdk-long-name}, verify the following:

* You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local macOS or Linux computer.

* You have downloaded and installed the Rust programming language and Cargo as described in the link:https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html[Rust installation instructions] for your operating system.

* You have downloaded and installed the {sdk-long-name} package as described in link:../../quickstart/quickstart{outfilesuffix}#download-and-install[Download and install].

* You have stopped any {IC} network processes running on the local computer.

If you aren’t sure how to open a new terminal shell on your local computer, run commands in a terminal, or how to check for and install packages, see link:newcomers{outfilesuffix}[Preliminary steps for newcomers]. 
If you are comfortable meeting the prerequisites without instructions, continue to <<Get the latest {cdk-short-name}>>.

[[download-cdk]]
== Get the latest {cdk-short-name}

You can download the latest version of the {cdk-long-name} from the link:https://crates.io/[Rust community’s crate registry] or from the link:https://github.com/dfinity/rust-cdk[Rust CDK] repository.

To get the latest {cdk-short-name} from the repository:

[arabic]
. Open a browser and navigate to the link:https://github.com/dfinity/rust-cdk[DFINITY Rust CDK] repository.
. Click **Code** to view the instructions for using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI to clone the repository, or to download a ZIP file of the repository directly.
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer.
+
For example, open Applications, Utilities, then double-click *Terminal* or press kbd:[{commandkey} + spacebar] to open Search, then type `terminal`.
. Download the {cdk-short-name} package using the appropriate command.
+
For example, you can clone the repository to a local working directory using SSH by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:dfinity/rust_cdk.git
----
. List the contents of the `+rust_cdk/src+` directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
ls -l rust_cdk/src
----
+
. Verify you have the following packages available to used:
+
....
ic_cdk
ic_cdk_macros
ic_cdk_optimizer
....

[[create-a-new-project]]
== Create a new project

Applications for the {IC} start as **projects**.
You can create new projects for the {IC} using either Cargo or the {sdk-short-name}.
Because you are building this project to be deployed on the {IC}, this tutorial focuses on how to create, build, and deploy a Rust program by using the `+dfx+` parent command and its subcommands.
However, creating a new project with `+cargo new+` adds some default files to the project directory structure—such as the `+Cargo.lock+` and `+Cargo.toml+` files—that you will need in your development environment.

* If you decide to use Cargo to create your project, you will need to manually add some files that the {cdk-long-name} requires.
* If you decide to use {sdk-short-name} to create your project, you will need to manually add some files that Cargo requires.

To create a new project using the {sdk-short-name}:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Create a new project named `+rust_hello+` by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new rust_hello
----
+
The `+dfx new rust_hello+` command creates a new `+rust_hello+` project directory, template files, and a new `+rust_hello+` Git repository for your project.
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd rust_hello
----

== Modify the default configuration

Creating a new project adds a default `+dfx.json+` configuration file to your project directory.
This file contains settings required to build a project for the {IC} much like the `+Cargo.toml+` file provides build and package management configuration details for Rust programs.
You need to modify the default settings in both of these files to build Rust programs that run on the {IC} as canisters.

=== Edit canister settings

To modify the `+dfx.json+` configuration file:

. Open the `+dfx.json+` configuration file in a text editor.
. Notice that under the `+canisters+` key, you have some default settings for the `+rust_hello+` canister such as the default path to the main program file and a default type of `+motoko+`.
. Replace the `+canisters.rust_hello.main+` key and setting with a `+canisters.rust_hello.build+` key and specify the `+cargo build+` command to execute.
+
For example:
+
[source, json]
----
"build": "cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --package rust_hello",
----
. Add a `+canisters.rust_hello.candid+` key and specify the location of the Candid interface description file to use for the canister.
+
For example:
+
[source, json]
----
"candid": "src/rust_hello/rust_hello.did",
----
. Add a `+canisters.rust_hello.wasm+` key and specify the location of the compiled WebAssembly file to use for the canister.
+
For example:
+
[source, json]
----
"wasm": "target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/rust_hello.wasm",
----
. Modify the `+canisters.rust_hello.type+` key and specify `+custom+` as the canister type.
+
For example:
+
[source, json]
----
"type": "custom"
----
. Remove all of the `+rust_hello_assets+` configuration settings from the file.
+
The sample program for this tutorial doesn't use any front-end assets, so you can remove those settings from the configuration file.
+
For example, the configuration file looks like this after you remove the `+rust_hello_assets+` section:
+
....
include::example$rust-dfx.json[]
....
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

=== Edit Cargo settings

To modify the `+Cargo.toml+` configuration file:

. Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed.
. Create a new file named `+Cargo.toml+` if you created the project using `+dfx+` or open the default `+Cargo.toml+` file if you created the project using Cargo.
. Use the [workspace] key to specify the source file directories for your program.
+
For example:
+
[source,toml]
----
[workspace]
members = [
    "src/rust_hello",
]
----
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.
. Change to the source code directory for your program.
+
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd  src/rust_hello
----
. Create a second file named `+Cargo.toml+` and open it in a text editor.
. Configure settings for your project.
+
At a minimum, you need to configure the following sections with basic information about the package name, location of the main program to compile, and the location of the {cdk-short-name} libraries
+
--
* `+[package]+`
* `+[lib]+`
* `+[dependencies]+`
--
+
For example, you should have a `+Cargo.toml+` file with settings similar to the following for this tutorial:
+
[source,toml]
----
[package]
name = "rust_hello"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name <your-email@example.com>"]
edition = "2018"

[lib]
path = "main.rs"
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
ic_cdk = { path = "../../../rust-cdk/src/ic_cdk", version = "0.1.0" }
ic_cdk_macros = { path = "../../../rust-cdk/src/ic_cdk_macros", version = "0.1.0" }
candid = "0.6.4"
serde = "1.0.111"
----
+
NOTE: Replace the path to the `+ic_cdk+` and `+ic_cdk_macros+` packages with the appropriate path for your local computer.
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

== Replace the default program

Creating a new project creates a default `+src+` directory with a template `+main.mo+` file.
In this tutorial, you replace that file with a main.rs file to create a simple "Hello World" program.

To replace the default template source code:

. Check that you are still in the source code directory, if needed.
. Rename the template `+main.mo+` file to main.rs by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mv main.mo main.rs
----
. Open the template `+main.rs+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Write a simple `+print+` function that uses the {cdk-short-name} `+query+` macro.
+
For example:
+
[source,rust]
----
#[ic_cdk_macros::query]
fn print() {
    ic_cdk::print("Hello World from DFINITY!");
}
----
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

== Add an interface description file

Candid is an interface description language (IDL) for interacting with canisters running on the Internet Computer.
Candid files provide a language-independent description of  a canister's interfaces including the names, parameters, and result formats and data types for each function a canister defines.

By adding Candid files to your project, you can ensure that data is properly converted from its definition in Rust to run safely on the {IC}.

To see details about the Candid interface description language syntax, see the link:../candid-spec/IDL{outfilesuffix}[Candid Specification] or the https://docs.rs/candid/[Candid crate documentation].

To add a Candid file for this tutorial:

. Check that you are still in the project `+src/rust_hello+` source code directory, if needed.
. Create a new file named `+rust_hello.did+`.
. Open the file in a text editor, then copy and paste the following `+service+` definition for the `+print+` function:
+
[source,did]
----
service : {
    "print": () -> () query;
}
----
+
This definition specifies that the data passed to the `+print+` function is returned unchanged as a `+query+` result.
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

[[start-the-local-network]]
== Start the local network

Before you can build your project, you need to connect to the {IC} network either running locally in your development environment or running remotely on a sub-network that you can access.

As a best practice, this step requires you to have **two terminal shells** open, so that you can start and see network operations in one terminal and manage your project in another.

To start the network locally:

[arabic]
. Navigate back to the root directory of your project.
. Open a new second terminal window or tab on your local computer and navigate to your project directory.
+
For example, you can do either of the following if running Terminal on macOS:
+
--
* Click *Shell*, then select *New Tab* to open a new terminal in your current working directory.
* Click *Shell* and select *New Window*, then run `+cd ~/ic-projects/hello+` in the new terminal if your `+hello+` project is in the `+ic-projects+` working folder.
--
+
You should now have **two terminals** open with your **project directory** as your **current working directory**.
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer in your second terminal by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start
----
+
Depending on your platform and local security settings, you might see a warning displayed. 
If you are prompted to allow or deny incoming network connections, click *Allow*.
. Leave the terminal window that displays network operations open and switch your focus to the first terminal window where you created your new project.
+
You perform all of the remaining project-related steps in this terminal.

[[register-ids]]
== Register and deploy your project

After you connect to the {IC} network running locally in your development environment, you can register, build, and deploy your project locally.

To register, build, and deploy:

. Check that you are still in root directory for your project directory, if needed.
. Register, build, and deploy the canisters specified in the `+dfx.json+` file by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy
----
+
The `+dfx deploy+` command output displays information about each of the operations it performs similar to the following excerpt:
+
....

....
. Call the `+print+` function in the program by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call rust_hello print
----
. Switch to the terminal window that displays network operations.
. Verify that the call to the rust_hello canister `+print+` function displays the `+Hello World from DFINITY!+` greeting.
+
For example:
+
....
[Canister 75hes-oqbaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q] Hello World from DFINITY!
....
+
NOTE: Because you are running the {IC} network in a separate terminal, the greeting is displayed in the terminal that displays network activity.
If you were to run `+dfx start+` with the `+--background+` option, the greeting would be displayed in the same terminal where you ran the `+dfx canister call+` command.

== Stop the local network

After testing the application, you can stop the local Internet Computer network so that it doesn’t continue running in the background.

To stop the local network:

. In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process.

. Stop the local {IC} network running on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
