[[quick-start-intro]]
The {cdk-long-name} provides tools, sample code, and documentation to help you create programs to run on the {IC} network.
This _Hello, World! Rust CDK Quick Start_ assumes that you are installing the {cdk-short-name} for the first time. 

To help you get started, this tutorial illustrates how to modify the traditional "Hello World" first program to use the {cdk-short-name}. 
This simple program has just one function that prints text to a terminal, but it provides a good model for understanding the workflow when writing programs in Rust that you want to deploy on the {IC}.

[[before-you-begin]]
== Before you begin

Before you download and install the {cdk-long-name}, verify the following:

* You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local macOS or Linux computer.

* You have downloaded and installed the Rust programming language and Cargo as described in the link:https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html[Rust installation instructions] for your operating system.

+
[source,bash]
----
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
----

* You have downloaded and installed the {sdk-long-name} package as described in link:../../quickstart/quickstart{outfilesuffix}#download-and-install[Download and install].

* You have `+cmake+` installed. For example, use Homebrew with the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
brew install cmake
----
+
For instructions on how to install Homebrew, see the link:https://docs.brew.sh/Installation[Homebrew Documentation].

* You have stopped any {IC} network processes running on the local computer.

If you aren’t sure how to open a new terminal shell on your local computer, run commands in a terminal, or how to check for and install packages, see link:../quickstart/newcomers{outfilesuffix}[Preliminary steps for newcomers]. 
If you are comfortable meeting the prerequisites without instructions, continue to <<Create a new project,Create a new project>>.

[[create-a-new-project]]
== Create a new project 

Applications for the {IC} start as **projects**.
You can create new projects for the {IC} using either Cargo or the {sdk-short-name}.
Because you are building this project to be deployed on the {IC}, this tutorial focuses on how to create, build, and deploy a Rust program by using the `+dfx+` parent command and its subcommands.
However, creating a new project with `+cargo new+` adds some default files to the project directory structure—such as the `+Cargo.lock+` and `+Cargo.toml+` files—that you will need in your development environment.

* If you decide to use Cargo to create your project, you will need to manually add some files that the {cdk-long-name} requires.
* If you decide to use {sdk-short-name} to create your project, you will need to manually add some files that Cargo requires.

To create a new project using the {sdk-short-name}:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Create a new project named `+rust_hello+` by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new rust_hello
----
+
The `+dfx new rust_hello+` command creates a new `+rust_hello+` project directory, template files, and a new `+rust_hello+` Git repository for your project.
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd rust_hello
----

== Modify the default configuration

Creating a new project adds several template files to your project directory much like when you create a new Rust package using the `+cargo new+` command.
You need to modify these default files and add some Rust-specific files to your project before you can build canisters that run on the {IC}.

=== Replace the default program

Creating a new project creates a default `+src/rust_hello+` directory with a template `+main.mo+`. We'll replace this default program with a Rust library `+lib.rs+` package and `+Cargo.toml+` files. 

To replace the default program:

. In the terminal, check that you are in the root directory for your project, if needed.
. Delete the template `+main.mo+` file by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
---- 
rm src/rust_hello/main.mo
----
. Create a new cargo package using a library template by running the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
cargo init --lib
----
+
This command creates a `+src+` directory with a library (`+lib.rs+`) package and a `+Cargo.toml+` file in the project directory.

=== Edit Cargo settings for the project

To modify `+Cargo.toml+` configuration file for the project:

. Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed.
. Open the default `+Cargo.toml+` file you created by running the `+cargo init+` command in a text editor.
. Delete the current content.
. Use the `+[workspace]+` key to specify the source file directories for your program.
+
For example:
+
[source,toml]
----
[workspace]
members = [
    "src/rust_hello",
]
----
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

=== Add Cargo settings for the Rust package

To add a `+Cargo.toml+` configuration file for the main program:

. Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed.
. Create a new Cargo package using a library template by running the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
cargo init --lib src/rust_hello
----
+
This command creates a `+src+` directory with a library (`+lib.rs+`) package and a `+Cargo.toml+` file in the `+src/rust_hello+` directory.
. Open the `+src/rust_hello/Cargo.toml+` file in a text editor.
+
You use this file to configure the details used to build the Rust package.
+
At a minimum, you need to configure the following sections with basic information about the package name, the crate type, and the version of the {cdk-short-name} libraries to use. 
+
--
* `+[package]+`
* `+[lib]+`
* `+[dependencies]+`
--
. Delete the existing `+[dependencies]+` section and replace it with the following:
+
[source,toml]
----
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
ic-cdk = "0.2.4"
ic-cdk-macros = "0.2.4"
----
+
NOTE: When you deploy the app later in the tutorial, you might get an error message that the dependency version is wrong. If there is a newer version of the {cdk-short-name}, update the dependencies in this file to that version. 
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

=== Edit canister settings

Your project directory includes a default `+dfx.json+` configuration file.
This file contains settings required to build a project for the {IC} much like the `+Cargo.toml+` file provides build and package management configuration details for Rust programs.
You need to modify the default settings in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file to build Rust programs that run on the {IC} as canisters.

To modify the `+dfx.json+` configuration file:

. Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed.
. Open the `+dfx.json+` configuration file in a text editor.
. Notice that under the `+canisters+` key, you have some default settings for the `+rust_hello+` canister such as the default path to the main program file and a default type of `+motoko+`.
. Replace the `+canisters.rust_hello.main+` key and setting with a `+canisters.rust_hello.build+` key and specify the `+cargo build+` command to execute.
+
For example:
+
[source, json]
----
"build": "cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --package rust_hello --release",
----
. Add a `+canisters.rust_hello.candid+` key and specify the location of the Candid interface description file to use for the canister.
+
For example:
+
[source, json]
----
"candid": "src/rust_hello/rust_hello.did",
----
. Add a `+canisters.rust_hello.wasm+` key and specify the location of the compiled WebAssembly file to use for the canister.
+
For example:
+
[source, json]
----
"wasm": "target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/rust_hello.wasm",
----
. Modify the `+canisters.rust_hello.type+` key and specify `+custom+` as the canister type.
+
For example:
+
[source, json]
----
"type": "custom"
----
. Remove all of the `+rust_hello_assets+` configuration settings from the file.
+
The sample program for this tutorial doesn't use any front-end assets, so you can remove those settings from the configuration file.
+
Optionally, you can also remove the `+defaults+`, `+dfx+`, and `+network+` keys if you are deploying this tutorial program locally using the default local host and port number.
+
For example, the configuration file looks like this after you remove the `+rust_hello_assets+` section:
+
....
include::example$rust-dfx.json[]
....

. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

== Modify the program file

To replace the default template source code:

. Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed.
. Open the template `+src/rust_hello/src/lib.rs+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Write a simple `+print+` function that uses the {cdk-short-name} `+query+` macro.
+
For example:
+
[source,rust]
----
#[ic_cdk_macros::query]
fn print() {
    ic_cdk::print("Hello World from DFINITY!");
}
----
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

== Add an interface description file

Candid is an interface description language (IDL) for interacting with canisters running on the Internet Computer.
Candid files provide a language-independent description of  a canister's interfaces including the names, parameters, and result formats and data types for each function a canister defines.

By adding Candid files to your project, you can ensure that data is properly converted from its definition in Rust to run safely on the {IC}.

To see details about the Candid interface description language syntax, see the link:../candid-guide/candid-intro{outfilesuffix}[_Candid Guide_] or the https://docs.rs/candid/[Candid crate documentation].

To add a Candid file for this tutorial:

. Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed.
. Create a new file in the `+src/rust_hello/+` directory named `+rust_hello.did+`.
. Open the `+src/rust_hello/src/rust_hello.did+`file in a text editor.
. Copy and paste the following `+service+` definition for the `+print+` function:
+
[source,did]
----
service : {
    "print": () -> () query;
}
----
+
This definition specifies that the data passed to the `+print+` function is returned unchanged as a `+query+` result.
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

[[start-the-local-network]]
== Start the local network

Before you can build your project, you need to connect to the {IC} network either running locally in your development environment or running remotely on a sub-network that you can access.

To start the network locally:

[arabic]
. Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed.
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer in the background by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start --background
----
+
Depending on your platform and local security settings, you might see a warning displayed. 
If you are prompted to allow or deny incoming network connections, click *Allow*.

[[register-ids]]
== Register, build, and deploy your project

After you connect to the {IC} network running locally in your development environment, you can register, build, and deploy your project locally.

To register, build, and deploy:

. Check that you are still in root directory for your project directory, if needed.
. Register, build, and deploy the canisters specified in the `+dfx.json+` file by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy
----
+
The `+dfx deploy+` command output displays information about each of the operations it performs similar to the following excerpt:
+
....

== Optimize and test the program

At this point, you have a program compiled to WebAssembly that has not been optimized for deployment on the {IC}. 

To optimize and test the resulting canister:

. Check that you are still in root directory for your project directory, if needed.
. Install the `+ic-cdk-optimizer+` crate by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cargo install ic-cdk-optimizer
----
+
This package optimizes your Rust code to reduce the size of the WebAssembly output to ensure your program can be uploaded as a canister.
. Create a release directory within the `+src/rust_hello+` directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p src/rust_hello/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/
----
. Optimize the code within the `+target/rust_hello+` directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
ic-cdk-optimizer target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/rust_hello.wasm -o target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/rust_hello-opt.wasm
----
. Call the `+print+` function in the program by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call rust_hello print
----
. Verify that the call to the `+rust_hello+` canister `+print+` function displays the `+Hello World from DFINITY!+` greeting.
+
For example:
+
....
[Canister rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai] Hello World from DFINITY!
....

== Stop the local network

After testing the application, you can stop the local Internet Computer network so that it doesn’t continue running in the background.

To stop the local network:

. In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process.

. Stop the local {IC} network running on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
