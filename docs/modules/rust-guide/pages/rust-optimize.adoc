Compiling Rust programs to WebAssembly often increases the file size of the program significantly. The {cdk-short-name} includes a helper library—`+ic-cdk-optimizer+`—that you can use to reduce the size of Rust-based canisters before deploying them on the {IC}.

== Before you begin

Before you optimize your program, verify the following:

* You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local macOS or Linux computer.

* You have downloaded and installed the Rust programming language and Cargo as described in the link:https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html[Rust installation instructions] for your operating system.

+
[source,bash]
----
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
----
+
The Rust tool chain must be at version 1.46.0, or later.

* You have downloaded and installed the {sdk-long-name} package as described in link:../../quickstart/quickstart{outfilesuffix}#download-and-install[Download and install].

* You have `+cmake+` installed. For example, use Homebrew with the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
brew install cmake
----
For instructions on how to install Homebrew, see the link:https://docs.brew.sh/Installation[Homebrew Documentation].

* You have successfully compiled your program to a WebAssembly module (WASM) and deployed it on the {IC} running locally.

== Install and run the optimizer

To optimize a canister that resulted from compiling a Rust program:

. Check that you are still in root directory for your project directory, if needed.
. Install the `+ic-cdk-optimizer+` crate, if you have not previously installed it, by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cargo install ic-cdk-optimizer
----
+
This package optimizes your Rust code to reduce the size of the WebAssembly output to ensure your program can be uploaded to the {IC} network as a canister.
. Create a release directory within the `+src+` directory for your program by running a command similar to the following:
+
[source,bash,subs=quotes]
----
mkdir -p src/_rust-canister_/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/
----
. Optimize the code within the `+target+` directory by running a command similar to the following:
+
[source,bash,subs-quotes]
----
ic-cdk-optimizer target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/_rust_canister_.wasm -o target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/_rust_canister_-opt.wasm
----
