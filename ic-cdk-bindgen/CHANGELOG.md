## [unreleased]

### New API Design

The `ic-cdk-bindgen` crate introduces a completely redesigned API to integrate seamlessly with `ic-cdk` v0.18 and later:
- The new API centers around the `Config` struct, requiring explicit specification of canister name and candid path.
- The bindgen now supports two modes:
  - `static_callee`: The canister ID is known at compile time.
  - `dynamic_callee`: The canister ID will be fetched via ICP environment variables at runtime.
- The "Type Selector" config can be set to customize how Candid types are translated to Rust types.
- Removed implicit handling of `dfx` environment variables. See the "Use with `dfx`" section in the crate documentation for more info.

## [0.1.3] - 2024-02-27

### Added

- Resolve CANISTER_CANDID_PATH and CANISTER_ID from standardized environment variables (uppercase canister names). (#467)
