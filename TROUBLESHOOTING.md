# Troubleshooting

## I was linked here by a Cargo error!

If your Cargo command produces the following error:

```
error: failed to select a version for `ic-cdk-executor`.
    ... required by package `yourcrate v0.1.0 (/Users/you/yourcrate)`
versions that meet the requirements `0.1.0` are: 0.1.0

the package `ic-cdk-executor` links to the native library `ic-cdk async executor`, but it conflicts with a previous package which links to `ic-cdk async executor` as well:
package `ic-cdk-executor v1.0.0`
    ... which satisfies dependency `ic-cdk-executor = "^1.0.0` of package `someothercrate v0.1.0`
Only one package in the dependency graph may specify the same links value. This helps ensure that only one copy of a native library is linked in the final binary. Try to adjust your dependencies so that only one package uses the `links = "ic-cdk async executor"` value. For more information, see https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/resolver.html#links.

failed to select a version for `ic-cdk-executor` which could resolve this conflict
```

You have two incompatible versions of `ic-cdk` (or `ic-cdk-timers`) in your dependency tree. There are two common reasons for this.

First, a dependency may be using an older (or newer) version of the CDK. Many versions are compatible with each other, but versions 0.17 and earlier are incompatible with version 0.18, and 0.18 is incompatible with 0.19 or later. You will have to wait for those dependencies to update, or patch them yourself.

Second, a dependency may be using a nominally compatible version of the CDK, but you are using a GitHub prerelease of the CDK with `ic-cdk = { git =`. Git dependencies are automatically incompatible with everything, even if nothing changed. You will need to create a [patch table](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html) that replaces all CDK dependencies with a Git dependency at the same commit.

You can find the dependencies responsible with the command `cargo tree -i ic-cdk`.
